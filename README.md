# p25MatrixModels
openscad and stl files to create brackets for p25 matrix displays


Different panels seem to have different screw spacing. Edit the openscad and generate new STL files if your spacing doesn't match.
This library will kick out brackets to attach the panels together, as well as hang the power supplies, terminal strips, and receiving boards off the back.
